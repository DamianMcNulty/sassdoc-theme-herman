Herman [a SassDoc theme]
========================

```
npm install sassdoc-theme-herman
```

At [OddBird][oddbird],
we wanted to a tool to help us
document the entire front end of a project,
from brand guidelines to UX Elements and code patterns.
Herman is our odd [SassDoc][SassDoc] theme,
still in alpha-development,
with a number of extra features for documenting
user-experience and code patterns:

- Font specimens
- Color palettes
- SVG icon previews
- Referencing & rendering Jinja/Nunjucks macros from the Sass docs
- more on the way!
