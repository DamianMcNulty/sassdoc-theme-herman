> An Odd SassDoc Theme.

At OddBird,
we wanted to a tool to help us
document the entire front end of a project:

1. Brand Guidelines
2. UX Elements
3. Code Patterns

We couldn't find a pattern-library tool
that would let us document patterns using
live Jinja/html along side live Sass/CSS,
and give direct access to Sass configuration maps.
Enter Herman.


```
npm install sassdoc-theme-herman
```
